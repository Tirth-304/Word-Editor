# Word-Editor

While learning ReactJs, I have made this project Word-Editor which can be used in many ways to manipulate text
In this project, I have used all concepts of ReactJs like
1. Components Rendering (e.g. - Rendered Navbar from seprate file as component in App.jsx File)
2. Props (e.g. - In TextForm.jsx part passed heading as props and then displayed it on Home Page)
3. State (e.g. - With the help of State variable made feature of Dark Mode in Website)
4. Conditional Rendering (e.g. - If user has selected Dark Mode then applied different color properties)
